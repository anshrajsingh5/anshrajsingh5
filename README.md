## System Architecture Philosophy

My approach to software delivery is centered on three core pillars:

1. **Performance First**: Utilizing Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to ensure sub-second page transitions and optimal Core Web Vitals.
2. **Infrastructure Hardening**: implementing secure Nginx configurations, automated backups, and server-level security protocols on Ubuntu VPS environments.
3. **Business Alignment**: Ensuring that every line of code serves a measurable business objective, from SEO visibility to operational automation.
